I have a notes app.

- The app is written in django 5. using SQlite to store data, and minio, to store note attachments.
- I have session-based authentication
- I use django rest framework
- I use next js for front end(more info under `.github/instructions/next-front.instructions.md`). Though I am planning to migrate to react because I don't use server side features of it.
- Also use react bootstrap 5 for the front end.
- notes are parsed and shown as markdown
- It has several features organized as follows:

  ## Basic Note Operations
  - editing a note
  - adding note category(each note should belong to only one category)
  - note importance: allows increasing or decreasing the importance level of notes for prioritization. Backend: django-backend/note/views/note_view.py (IncreaseImportanceView, DecreaseImportanceView), URLs: increase_importance/, decrease_importance/
  - archiving notes: enables archiving and unarchiving notes to hide/show them from main views. Backend: django-backend/note/views/note_view.py (ArchiveMessageView, UnArchiveMessageView), URLs: archive/, unarchive/
  - moving notes: allows changing the category of a note. Backend: django-backend/note/views/note_view.py (MoveMessageView), URL: move/
  - note revisions: tracks and stores historical revisions of notes for change history. Backend: django-backend/note/models.py (NoteRevision), views/note_view.py (NoteRevisionView), URL: revisions/<note_id>/

  ## Content and Search
  - linking to other notes, backlinking from them.
  - hashtags: extracts hashtags from note text and provides trending hashtags based on usage frequency. Backend: django-backend/note/views/hashtag_view.py (TrendingHashtagsView), URL: hashtags/trending/
  - search functionality: advanced text search with support for AND/OR queries, filtering by categories, hidden/archived status, and file presence. Backend: django-backend/note/views/search_view.py (SearchResultsView), URL: search/
  - there is a similar notes feature that basically shows a similar notes. I'm still working to improve this

  ## Organization
  - there is a workspaces feature that lets you group categories into workspaces and allows you to focus on certain categories at a time.
    - each category can belong to 0 to many workspaces
  - file collections - separate from notes, collections organize files with thumbnail previews in feed
  - unified feed: displays a chronological feed combining notes and file collections. Backend: django-backend/note/views/collection_view.py (UnifiedFeedView), URL: feed/

  ## Sharing
  - public notes: allows sharing notes publicly by placing them in a 'public' category. Backend: django-backend/note/views/public_note_view.py (PublicNoteView), URL: pp/

  ## Notifications
  - reminders: scheduling reminders for notes with options for frequency (once, daily, weekly, monthly), text highlighting, and email notifications. Backend: django-backend/note/models.py (Reminder), views/reminder_view.py (ReminderView), URLs: reminders/
  - email notifications: sends email reminders for scheduled notes. Backend: django-backend/note/tasks.py (send_reminder_email Celery task)

  ## Data Insights
  - statistics: provides stats on note revisions, note creation, and file access over time periods. Backend: django-backend/note/views/stats_view.py (RevisionStatsView, NoteStatsView, FileAccessStatsView), URLs: stats/revisions/, stats/notes/, stats/access/

  ## File Handling
  - file management: handles file uploads, listing, details, and serving from MinIO storage. Backend: django-backend/note/models.py (File), views/file_view.py, URLs: upload/, files/, etc.

  ### File Collections

  File collections are a separate content type from notes that organize files without text content:
  - **Model**: `FileCollection` in `django-backend/note/models.py`
  - **Display**: Collections appear in the unified feed alongside notes in chronological order
    - Shows thumbnail preview of first 4 files
    - Displays file count and category name
    - Clicking opens dedicated file manager page at `/collection/{id}`
  - **File Manager**: Grid view page for managing collection files
    - Upload files (drag-and-drop supported)
    - Remove files from collection (doesn't delete file itself)
    - View file thumbnails for images, icons for other types
  - **File Sharing**: Files stored in MinIO can be:
    - Referenced in notes via markdown
    - Added to multiple collections
    - Shared across collections and notes (same physical file, multiple references)
    - Files stored at `uploads/{user_id}/{random_str}_{filename}` regardless of collection

  ## UI/UX
  - dark mode toggle. This is being handled using boostrap. So don't use dark, light variant
  - session management: manages user sessions. Frontend: next-front/app/(auth)/ components

current structure of the project main dirs:
.
├── django-backend (.venv is here)
├── docker-compose.yml
├── minio-data
├── next-front
├── nginx
├── notes-react-native
├── nuxt-front
├── README.md

nuxt is just old and deprecated and I'm not developing react native for now

some words are used interchangably as the code have evaloved.

note: LocalMessage

## Development Operations

### Running Scripts

All scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory and must be run using the `./script` wrapper from the project root:

**Format**: `./script <script_name>.sh [params]`

### Database Management

- **Restore database**: `./script restore_db.sh`
- **Backup database**: `./script backup_db.sh`

### Django Management Commands

**Always use the dev_tools.sh wrapper for any `manage.py` commands.**

**Format**: `./script dev_tools.sh <manage.py_command> [params]`

Common commands:

- Migrations: `./script dev_tools.sh migrate`
- Generate embeddings: `./script dev_tools.sh generate_embeddings`
- Any other manage.py command: `./script dev_tools.sh <command>`

### Docker Configuration (Development)

- Development uses a separate Docker Compose file: `docker-compose.dev.yml`

## Database

- the models for the main notes app are under `django-backend/note/models.py`
- I have three separate databases that get separated by using database routers `django-backend/note/router.py`.
- the main db is for notes, categories, users, sessions, etc
- the embeddings db is for storing note embeddings for similar notes feature
- the revision db is for storing note revisions

## formatting

- do not leave comments
